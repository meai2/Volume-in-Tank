# Volume-in-Tank
Value of depth showing the volume of liquid in the tank for that depth

Storage tanks are containers that hold liquids, compressed gases or mediums used for the short-
or long-term storage of heat or cold. Storage tanks are available in many shapes: vertical and
horizontal cylindrical; open top and closed top; at bottom, cone bottom, slope bottom and dish
bottom. Liquids are often stored in elliptical (cylindrical) storage tanks as shown in Figure 1.
To measure the volume of liquid in the tank, a depth gauge (measuring stick) can be used. It is
inserted into an opening at the top and the level of liquid on the gauge can be used to determine
the amount of liquid in the tank. Imagine the tank has width w, height h and length len (all in
meters).

We look at inserting a measuring stick that is already calibrated in units of 10 centimeters. This
measuring gauge can be inserted into an opening at the top of the tank and used to measure the
depth of the liquid in the tank.

This is a C program to compute a value for a specific depth showing the volume of liquid in the tank for that depth 
(e.g. 50cm or 370cm - always a multiplication of 10 centimeters).

The program should work for any values of w, h and len, and not just the specific values in the
sample outputs below. We are assuming here that the user inputs valid numbers all the time.
